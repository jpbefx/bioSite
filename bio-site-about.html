                    <p>For my bio, I chose to introduce the most interesting person I know. He has traveled every state in the Continental United States of America, and seen many places, things, people, and situations. This person is my Brother, David Long. I chose to do this because I like to hear of all the crazy places he’s seen and learn about all the interesting people he has encountered along the way. He has always been the first to jump in and help anyone in trouble, even when it means sacrificing time with his family and his own comfort. This first started when he was a young adult and grew into a career path, along with his love for trucks. </p>

                    <p>He grew his talents and knowledge of the industry until he broke out and created his own hauling company. Learning a ton over the duration of the company’s short time in his hands, David sold the company to his partner and moved on to pursue towing. This was for his family, as his daughter was coming to the age of daycare and would need to remain local to school.</p>

After moving to Florida in 2018 he became a huge talk of the towing industry there. He has been there a short four years and has worked four three companies and is constantly being contacted by large company’s recruiters. </p>
